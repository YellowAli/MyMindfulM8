## Devpost and Demo
The project submission for MyMindfulM8 can be viewed [here](https://devpost.com/software/mymindfulm8?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects).

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/gsYwpJ4L8Eg) on YouTube demonstrating the usage of MyMindfulM8. 

## Features
Drawing on studies, we emphasized the importance of mindfulness practices, incorporating evidence-backed techniques such as journaling and deep-breathing exercises. Research on the positive impact of social support on mental health guided the community-building aspect, highlighting the correlation between strong social connections and resilience. Additionally, the website incorporates information on the benefits of regular physical activity for mental well-being, referring to studies that underscored the positive effects of exercise on mood regulation and stress reduction. By grounding the platform in scientific findings, we aimed to provide users with insights and evidence-based tools to navigate and improve their overall health and well-being.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- React
- SQL

## Challenges Faced
We faced the challenge of translating complex research findings into digestible and actionable content that resonated with our broad target audience. Moreover, maintaining a user-centric approach posed its own set of challenges. Ensuring that the website was not just informative but also genuinely supportive required ongoing refinement and adaptation in such a short amount of time. Navigating the technical aspects of creating an interactive and engaging online platform was also a hurdle as we had to bridge the gap between our technical skills and the human-centered design necessary for an effective mental health resource.

## Accomplishments
As a team we are proud of the backend of our project and its ability to only allow entry from registered users. We are also overall proud of the visual aesthetic of the project including the use of animations.

## Lessons Learned
This hackathon and project helped each member on the team progress their knowledge in some shape or form depending on their role. Two of our front-end programmers had limited prior experience in React. Due to the nature of the project, the front-end programmers had to quickly adapt and use knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to guide them through the use of React. The developer working on the backend portion of the project also had to endure a steep learning curve and developed his skills in Python backend development using Flask and SQL, and incorporating authentication.

## Future Implementations
The next step for MyMindfulM8 is the finalization of its web application including the incorporation of infobip in order to send users daily reminders of their weekly goals, thus motivating the user and hindering the risks of procrastination. The finalized web application will also provide goals to the user through a database which will be updated weekly with new goals. This will allow the user to take small steps towards success all year round! Once the web application is finalized we aim to implement MyMindfulM8 as a phone application in order to increase the accessibility of its services.
